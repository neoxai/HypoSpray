# HypoSpray
Code Refactor for Visual Studio, to simplify dependency injection code.
 Based on the work of https://github.com/trydis/roslyn-introduce-and-init-field
 
 This is a code refactor for Visual Studio 2015, that will help reduce boilerplate copy/paste of interfaces, fields, and constructor parameters
 of dependencies that you are trying to inject into a class.
